# Hotel Reservation System

<h1>Background</h1>
My reasoning behind creating this application is from my serveral years working as a hotel receptionist, I feel as though I know the workings of these Front Desk/Reservation systems well. From my own opinion, and those I work with, and from interviews I conducted with others working in this field, I felt I had enough information gathered behind changes that everyone would like in the future of using these systems.<br>

This will compile the frontend of the Application.

<h1>Running</h1>
Once compiled, the frontend terminal will give the user the web address of the application :

From loading the address in a browser of the users choice, they will be able to create an account, and log into the system and create, modify and delete guests and booking profiles.
